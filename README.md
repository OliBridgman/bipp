This is a music game engine I'm working on. Currently the only working piece is the editor.

### Running

```
npm run-script dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:8080` and you should be in business. I recommend loading the demo song and chart in the `demo/` folder.

### Manual

```
sdf<space>jkl - set the 7 columns
p - toggle playback
up/down keys - move up and down
left/right keys - select movement resolution
pgup/pgdown - move up and down by measure
plus/minus - increase/decrease space between beats (think speed multipliers)
```
